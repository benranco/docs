Optimizations Summary:

- parallel processing (apply() functions are good for this)
- pre-compiling functions (cmpfn()) - best for new numerical computations, not so good for paste, or manipulations, etc)
- benchmarking using library(microbenchmark) and plotting using library(ggplot2) - autoplot()
- profiling code to determine which functions are taking the most time (Rprof())
- using faster functions/packages (eg. data.table library for processing data frames)


Improving your code:

- use vector math instead of for loops
     - eg. condition checking computations inside for loops can be moved outside the for loop and done in a vectorized way
     - most base r functions handle vectors as well as scalars
     - but apply() functions are actually wrappers for for loops
-- pre-allocate memory and then fill it rather than appending to a vector or list and making it resize
     - apply functions do pre-allocation for you
-- use a matrix instead of a data frame (only one data type), etc
- use Internal(mean(x)) instead of mean(x) - (with some caveats/warnings)
-- use C++ (RCpp) for loops that can't be vectorized, or functions that get called millions of times
-- for simple loops, use the ifelse notation instead (like Java's ? : condition) -> really fast
- use which() to select rows instead of a for loop
- parallelization with vectorization (see strategies article above)
-- remove objects (rm()) and flush memory (gc()) as soon and often as possible
-- use data.table() instead of data frame, it consumes less memory and faster

Not about optimizations, just coding questions:

- To discover the directory that R installs packages to: .libPaths()
- To change the directory that R installs packages to: .libPaths("/directory/path")
- To install a package for a library: install.packages("name", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
- To load a library: library("name")
- To load an R script into an R session: source("script.R")

Using an interactive R script (that uses readline()) in batch mode:

- basically, replace all uses of readline with a custom readlineB() function that uses scan() instead
