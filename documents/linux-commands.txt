    Redirect stdout to one file and stderr to another file: command > out 2>error.
    Redirect stderr to stdout ( &1 ), and then redirect stdout to a file: command >out 2>&1.
    Redirect both to a file: command &> out.

Use rsync, instead of scp! Better for updating/regular backups. Some useful options:
  -a : archive mode, same as -rlptgoD
  -u : skip files that are newer on the receiver
  -v : verbose
  --ignore-existing : skip updating files that exist on receiver
rsync -au /src/dir/ host:/dest/dir/
rsync -a --ignore-existing /src/dir/ host:/dest/dir/

To run a command as a background process, end with an &, but this will terminate if you exit from an ssh session in which you ran the command, so when you want the process to continue even after your ssh session ends, use the nohup (no hangups) command:

nohup command > log.txt



Grep:

Use grep on all lines of a file except the first line:

option1: cat R28-S91-M28K-Ben-filtered-map_js.txt | sed -n '1!p' | grep -c "expression"

option2: cat R28-S91-M28K-Ben-filtered-map_js.txt | awk '{if(NR>1)print}' | grep -c "expression"

Use grep to search for matches of an entire line: grep "^expression$" file

List line numbers of occurences: grep -n "expression" file

Count the number of occurences: grep -c "expression" file


Use grep to only print the segment of the matching lines that contains the matching string with padding of 0-20 characters on either side:

grep -oE ".{0,20}searchpattern.{0,20}"

An alternative way to truncate lines, piping it to cut to print only characters 10 to 90:

grep "searchpattern" | cut -c10-90
 

Count how many unique lines there are in a file:

option1: sort -u R28-S91-M28K-Ben-filtered-map_js.txt | wc -l

option2: sort R28-S91-M28K-Ben-filtered-map_js.txt | uniq | wc -l


head -10 file  <-- print the first 10 lines of file

tail -10 file  <-- print the last 10 lines of file

tail +10 file  <- print file beginning 10 lines from the front

wc -l  <-- count the number of lines in a file

ls | wc -l  <-- count the number of files in a directory


Read a file from line number X to line number Y (there are other ways too):

awk 'NR >= X && NR <= Y' filename 


To print out a range of lines from a file using sed:
sed -n 'startline,endline p; endline+1 q' in.txt > out.txt
  -n suppresses echoing the input as output
   p prints out the relevant lines
   q exit sed without processing rest of file


du -sch * --exclude=pattern <-- calculate total size of everything (in current dir), and give a grand total, human readable, excluding any file names that contain the given pattern

df <-- displays the directory path, size and used/available of your various drives

df -h <-- human readable sizes


Commands to find out how much free memory/RAM there is:

free -g

vmstat -s


If having problems formatting a drive or usb, install gparted (sudo yum install gparted), and use it. To apply any pending operations in gparted, click the green check mark. See:

https://www.unixmen.com/how-to-format-usb-properly-in-linux/ 

How to format usb drive in the terminal:

https://www.unixmen.com/how-to-format-usb-drive-in-the-terminal/


To searck for process id by command name:
ps -e | grep name
To kill all processes of a certain command:
pkill -9 name


Rename a common portion of all filenames in a directory:

rename ABC XYZ *.txt

or if you have a version of rename that takes perl regex:

rename 's/ABC/XYZ/' *.txt


Replace first occurrence of a comma within each line of a file with a dash:

sed -i 's/,/-/' filename

 

Replace all occurrences of a string within a file:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/20414/find-and-replace-text-within-a-file-using-commands

sed -i 's/original/new/g' filename


sed -i 's/\"X\/\"/\"X\/X\"/g' filename


sed -i 's/\"A\/\"/\"A\/A\"/g' filename

sed -i 's/\"C\/\"/\"C\/C\"/g' filename

sed -i 's/\"G\/\"/\"G\/G\"/g' filename

sed -i 's/\"T\/\"/\"T\/T\"/g' filename


Replace the first part of each line in a file:

sed 's/^[^ ]* /_/' filename # replaces all characters before the first space that aren't space on each line with _
sed 's/^[^\t]*/_/' filename # replaces all characters before the first tab that aren't tab on each line with _
sed 's/^[^\t]*\t//' filename # replaces all characters before the first tab as well as the first tab on each line with nothing


# bash script to do the above for each file in a folder:

path="/path/to/folder/"
for filename in $(ls $path)
do
    sed 's/^[^\t]*/_/' $path$filename > $path$filename"-edited.txt"
done



To format and mount a new disk drive to a folder on CentOS 7, from:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/385769/mount-an-entire-drive-to-a-subforlder-centos-7
First:
ls /dev
[It should be something like sdb]
[Create a new partition:]
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
[follow the directions, select n to create a new partition, use the defaults to fill up the whole disk, then select w to save and exit]
[Format the new partition as xfs:]
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
[Then create a directory at root level to mount it to:]
sudo mkdir /work
sudo mount -t xfs /dev/sdb1 /work
[Then do chmod and chown as desired. These permissions will be saved on the drive itself so you only need to do it once.]
[To unmount:]
sudo umount /work

To create a symbolic link to a directory or file, from:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9587445/how-to-create-a-link-to-a-directory
Symbolic or soft link (files or directories, more flexible and self documenting)
#     Source                             Link
ln -s /home/jake/doc/test/2000/something /home/jake/xxx
Hard link (files only, less flexible and not self documenting)
#   Source                             Link
ln /home/jake/doc/test/2000/something /home/jake/xxx



Very handy guides to disk drive management in CentOS (6).

Adding a separate mountable (and automountable) disk drive:

http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Adding_a_New_Disk_Drive_to_a_CentOS_System

Adding a drive/managing your Volume Group/Logical Volume(s) and Logical Volume Management (LVM) in CentOS. Very cool.

http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Adding_a_New_Disk_to_a_CentOS_Volume_Group_and_Logical_Volume

Some useful info commands: mount, vgdisplay (volume group(s)), lvdisplay (logical volumes), pvdisplay (physical volumes), ls /dev/sd*, cat /proc/partitions

Some useful create commands:

(I first created an xfs partition on the new drive using gparted. could also use fdisk)

sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1 # for example

sudo vgextend centos /dev/sdb1 # add it to the volume group

sudo lvextend -l+953861 /dev/centos/home # add 953861 logical extents to the home logical volume. alternatively:

sudo lvextend -L+3.6T /dev/centos/home # 3.6 Terrabytes to the home logical volume

# last step, revise the filesystem to use the new space (for centos 7 had to use xfs_growfs rather than resize2fs:

sudo xfs_growfs /dev/centos/home

# confirm:

df -h

# yum search is not a reliable way to find the packages. Use yum provides instead and use a filename that you know should be in the package that you want to find - e.g yum provides '*/File/Glob.pm'

yum list available 'name*'
sudo yum install 'name*'

sudo yum list installed | grep string

repoquery --list name

locate name
