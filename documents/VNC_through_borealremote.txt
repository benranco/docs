THIS IS ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE VNC ON A BOREAL CLOUD VM THROUGH REMOTE ACCESS.

-----------------------------------------
From Kristian about how to do scp through remote access:

Hey Ben,

Does your SSH command have the “-j” flag?

I don’t remember off-hand how to do it, but you should be able to use the “-j” flag to jump through borealremote to borealcloud.  My ssh doesn’t support it.

I have shell access on borealremote, so what I do is this (and maybe without shell it might still work):

ssh -L 2225:borealcloud.nfis.org:22 karndt@borealremote.nfis.org   <- logs me into borealremote with port tunnel from localhost:2223 to port 22 (ssh) on borealcloud

Keep the first command open.

Then:
scp -P 2223 myfile.txt karndt@localhost:

Cheers,

Kristian.

From the man ssh page on CentOS 8: 

-J destination
       Connect to the target host by first making a ssh connection to the jump host described by destination and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from
       there.  Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.  This is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJump configuration directive.  Note that configuration direc‐
       tives supplied on the command-line generally apply to the destination host and not any specified jump hosts.  Use ~/.ssh/config to specify configuration for jump hosts.

My attempt to use ssh -J:

First I created a .ssh/config file with this in it: 
Host borealremote
  Hostname borealremote.nfis.org
  User brancourt
  Port 22

Then:
ssh -J borealremote brancourt@borealpfc.nfis.org

My attempt to set up an ssh tunnel to borealpfc using Kristian's advice and the 
stuff I learned about ssh tunneling while working on VNC stuff:

Not much luck through borealremote:

This didn't work going through borealremote, maybe because I don't have shell access:
ssh -v -L 2224:borealpfc.nfis.org:22 -N -l brancourt borealremote.nfis.org
Then (note I used my username for borealpfc):
scp -P 2224 brancourt@localhost:~/hello.txt .

Using scp -J option through borealremote didn't work: 
scp -J borealremote brancourt@borealpfc.nfis.org:~/test2.txt .

Much better success through inf2: 

This worked for going through inf2 (maybe I'll just always use port 2223 for inf2):
ssh -v -L 2223:borealpfc.nfis.org:22 -N -l brancour inf2.pfc.forestry.ca
Then (note I used my username for borealpfc):
Recieve a file:
scp -P 2223 brancourt@localhost:~/move_files_in_list.sh .
scp -P 2223 brancourt@localhost:~/hello.txt .
Send a file:
scp -P 2223 ./test.txt brancourt@localhost:~/
Trying ssh (has to be a small -p) worked: 
ssh -p 2223 brancourt@localhost
Perhaps I could do a second ssh tunnel through the first one for VNC (not tested):
ssh -v -L 5901:10.20.0.88:5901 -N -p 2223 brancourt@localhost
ssh -v -L 5901:10.20.0.88:5901 -N -p 2223 -l brancourt localhost


These scp -J options worked through inf2 (configured in .ssh/config): 
scp -J inf2 brancourt@borealpfc.nfis.org:~/test.txt .
scp -J inf2 ./test2.txt brancourt@borealpfc.nfis.org:~/

Trying to use -J through ssh on inf2 seems to be prohibited:
ssh -J inf2 brancourt@borealpfc.nfis.org:~/test.txt .
brancour@inf2.pfc.forestry.ca's password: 
channel 0: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed
stdio forwarding failed
kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
