Trimmomatic jar file and manual downloaded from (quick start also on that page): 
http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic

I created a run script to run trimmomatic on multiple files in a folder: 
trimmomatic_ben_bash_sript.sh

Modify it as needed. Pay attention to trimmomatic parameters to suit your needs.
